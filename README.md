## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Instagram :
    - Refresh the screen with a new post.
    - Posting multiple photos.
- TikTok :
    - Have a New video every time the person scrolls.
    - Having follower from others to see their updates.
- Youtube :
    - Upload short or lengthy videos.
    -  Add Comments to the videos.

## Notes

I was confused about identifying the correct main file because there were two files associated with the term 'main.' One file was explicitly named 'main,' while the other contained 'main' in its code. This led to further confusion, as I ended up using the wrong main file and struggled to properly utilize the ViewController.
